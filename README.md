# Brilliant Mates Multiplayer Chess Game with Puzzles and Tools

## Brilliant Mates is a two person chess game where players are able to play and keep track of moves, undo and flip board, as well as the abilities to castle and use en passant.

My passion for the game of chess ispired me to make this game. Brilliant Mates can be used as a way to analyze games, complete puzzles, or just enjoy playing a casual game with a friend. Here are some features that this game includes:
- Flip board and undo move in the middle of the game or analysis
- Solving a random puzzle with chosen difficulty
- ability to save the game to a notation pgn that can be retreived in the future
- legal move recognition, piece promotion, piece trades, and most of the current chess rules
